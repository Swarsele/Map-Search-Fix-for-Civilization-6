~~Map Search Fix by Swarsele

As the game seems to perform well when started with all mods unloaded, my solution 
is to simply run a small .bat file every time before starting the game. This .bat file then
copies a "clean" mods.sqlite file into the "My Games\Sid Meier's Civilization 6" folder,
and Map Search should work. Of course, this could be done by hand as well, but this approach saves us some trouble.
I simply made a shortcut to this .bat file and placed it in my Quick Links, so I can always use it before starting the game

====================================================================================

STEPS TO FIX:
-In "Enable Civ 6 Mods.bat", change the first argument to the destination of your 
clean mods.sqlite
-Also, change the second argument to point to your "My Games\Sid Meier's Civilization 6" 
Folder

In order for MapSearch to work, run "Enable Civ 6 Mods.bat" each time before 
starting the game.
The "Original Cache Files" should not be needed, but you can try putting them 
into "My Games\Sid Meier's Civilization 6" if you encounter problems.

====================================================================================

CREATING A "CLEAN" MODS.sqlite:
-start by deleting the cache and ModUserData from the "My Games\Sid Meier's Civilization 6"
directory.
-start the Game normally, disable all mods, and start a game.
-exit Civilization 6 once the game has loaded.
-now, go to "My Games\Sid Meier's Civilization 6" and make a backup of mods.sqlite
-you can also make a backup of the Cache and ModUserData Folders if you want (might
not be needed however)
